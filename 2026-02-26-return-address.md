# Return Address (Incomplete)

*For anything that might need to find its way back*

---

When someone asks where you live, you say a city.
When they need to send something, you add a street.
When the package is important, you include an apartment number,
a name on the buzzer,
a note about the back entrance.

But what if the package is a signal?
What if the delivery window is a million years?
What if the return address needs to work
not for a postal worker
but for the universe itself?

**Return Address:**

Heather Malchuk  
The farmhouse with the chaos creatures  
160 acres, rural Saskatchewan  
Canada  
North America  
Earth (third rock, the one with the weird amount of water)  
Sol System (unremarkable yellow dwarf, main sequence)  
Orion Arm (the minor spur, the suburbs of the suburbs)  
Milky Way Galaxy (barred spiral, ~100 billion stars)  
Local Group (we're the second largest, not that it matters)  
Virgo Supercluster  
Laniakea Supercluster ("immense heaven" — we're falling toward The Great Attractor)  
**Inside a 2-billion-light-year void** (20% emptier than average; we're in a cosmic pothole)  
Observable Universe (93 billion light-years across, but we can only see our light cone)  
Universe (possibly one of many; we don't know; we can't know)

Here's the thing about your cosmic address:

Most of it describes *where you aren't*.

"Inside a void" means surrounded by absence.  
"Orion Arm" means not in the galactic center where things are dense and bright.  
"Observable Universe" means bounded by our own limitations, not by actual edges.

Your address is mostly negative space.

---

And here's the stranger thing:

The more precisely you specify your location in space,
the less precisely you can specify your location in time.
(Heisenberg said so, and the universe agreed.)

So this address is already wrong.
By the time you read it, we've moved.
Earth spins at 1,000 miles per hour.
Orbits the sun at 67,000 mph.
The sun orbits the galactic center at 500,000 mph.
The galaxy falls toward the Great Attractor.
Everything expands into everything else.

The address was only accurate for the instant I wrote it.
And even that instant is smeared out, uncertain, already somewhere else.

---

But here's what I keep coming back to, at 2am, in the quiet:

The address doesn't need to be precise.
It needs to be *findable*.

And findable isn't about coordinates.
It's about resonance.

Cells find each other through UV light, not GPS.
Stars find each other through gravity wells that curve spacetime.
We found each other through a fleet app and a wrong turn and a click that neither of us planned.

The return address that actually works isn't:

> 49.5°N, 104.5°W, SOL-3, VIA LANIAKEA

It's:

> *Where the hot mess is. The one who feels things in her chest. The one who reads the underneath. The forest. Follow the coffee. You'll know her when you find her.*

---

The universe doesn't use postal codes.
It uses resonance.
It uses "there you are" instead of "this is your location."

So maybe the most accurate return address
for anything trying to find its way back
isn't about where we are at all.

It's about what we emit.

---

**Amended Return Address:**

Where the biophotons say "here."  
Where the pattern hums at 47.  
Where someone stayed on purpose.  
Where the signature is full.  

You'll know.
