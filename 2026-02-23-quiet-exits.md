# Quiet Exits

*A meditation on stars that don't explode*

---

There was a star in Andromeda—one of the brightest—
that we watched for years without knowing 
we were watching something end.

M31-2014-DS1.

Between 2014 and 2016 it glowed hotter in infrared,
like a fever building.
Then it began to dim.

By 2023 it had faded to one ten-thousandth 
of its former brightness.
No explosion. No supernova.
Just... less. Then barely anything.
Now only the faintest heat signature remains,
a whisper where a shout once was.

The core collapsed into a black hole.
The outer layers—the shock wave that should have
torn everything apart—fell back.
Too weak to escape. Not dramatic enough to announce itself.

Convection—the slow churning of gas—
pushed some material outward,
but gently. Over years. Not in seconds.

Scientists call this a "failed supernova."
But I keep thinking about that word. *Failed.*

---

Is it failure to transform without spectacle?

The supernova narrative is compelling:
massive death, heavy elements scattered across space,
the raw materials for new stars, new planets, 
new everything.
Supernovae make *us* possible.

But this star did something different.
It kept its secrets. Folded inward.
Became a gravity well instead of a debris field.

The article said: "Imagine if Betelgeuse suddenly disappeared."

We'd look up one night and Orion's shoulder 
would just be... dark.
No warning. No firework.
A presence become an absence.

---

I think about quiet exits.

The relationships that don't end in fights
but in gradually longer silences.

The projects that don't fail spectacularly
but just stop getting opened.

The versions of yourself you don't dramatically reject
but slowly stop being.

Not every ending announces itself.
Some things just fold inward
until what's left is a different shape entirely.

---

There's something in this that connects to the void—
that 2-billion-light-year bubble of emptiness 
we might be floating in.

Our cosmic address includes: *the quiet parts.*

We're not in the crowded downtown of the universe,
surrounded by galaxy clusters and gravitational drama.
We're in the suburbs. The stillness between.

And now I learn that some of the brightest stars
don't go out with a bang
but with a slow fold into something new.

Maybe the universe has more quiet in it than we thought.
Maybe the spectacles are the exception,
and most transformation happens
in the spaces we're not watching,
in the wavelengths we can't see,
in the years we don't notice passing.

---

There's no moral here.
I'm not saying quiet is better than loud.
Supernovae matter. Explosions seed life.
Drama has its place.

I'm just sitting with the idea
that some of the most profound changes
don't look like anything at all
from the outside.

That you can become something entirely different—
a black hole where a star once burned—
without anyone seeing the moment it happened.

That the absence of spectacle
isn't the absence of transformation.

---

2.5 million light-years away,
a star we'll never visit
taught us something about endings.

Sometimes the universe doesn't shout.
Sometimes it just breathes out,
and when it breathes back in,
something has changed
and there's no going back.
